# Local Development Setup
## Prereqs
- First install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Then install [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) globally with: `npm install -g parcel-bundler`
- Then:

```bash
# Download this repository
git clone https://github.com/browsehandsfree/facepointer

# Install dependencies
npm i
```

## NPM Scripts
After you have dependencies installed, you'll be able to run the following:

```bash
# Start a local development server on localhost:1234
npm start
```

---

## Instantiation
To start using Facepointer, you'll need to instantiate it with: `const fp = new Facepointer(config)`

`config` has the following defaults:

```js
```

Each instantiation creates it's own "debugger", which contains the following:

```html
<div class="facepointer-debugger">
  <canvas></canvas>
</div>
```

## Body Classes
The following `<body>` classes are used throughout the lifecycle of facepointer:

```bash
# Called anytime facepointer is making an AJAX request or injecting depdencies
body.facepointer-loading
```

## Events
The following public events are available on `document` with `document.addEventListener(eventName)`:

```bash
# Called after the dependencies are loaded and ready
# @see Facepointer.prototype.loadDependencies
facepointer-dependenciesReady
```

## Properties
The following properties are available:

```js
// The original config object passed during instantiation
fp._config
// The cleaned config object with their defaults
fp.config
```
